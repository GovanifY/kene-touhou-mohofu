 * requested bits-per-pixel, but will return whatever video pixel format is
 * available.  The default is to emulate the requested pixel format if it
 * is not natively available.
 *
 * If SDL_HWSURFACE is set in 'flags', the video surface will be placed in
 * video memory, if possible, and you may have to call SDL_LockSurface()
 * in order to access the raw framebuffer.	Otherwise, the video surface
 * will be created in system memory.

 * updates asynchronously, but you must always lock before accessing pixels.
 * SDL will wait for updates to complete before returning from the lock.
 *
 * If SDL_HWPALETTE is set in 'flags', the SDL library will guarantee
 * that the colors set by SDL_SetColors() will be the colors you get.
 * Otherwise, in 8-bit mode, SDL_SetColors() may not be able to set all
 * of the colors exactly the way they are requested, and you should look
 * at the video surface structure to determine the actual palette.
 * If SDL cannot guarantee that the colors you request can be set,

 * scheme, but prevents "tearing" artifacts caused by modifying video
 * memory while the monitor is refreshing.	It should only be used by
 * applications that redraw the entire screen on every update.
 *
 * If SDL_RESIZABLE is set in 'flags', the SDL library will allow the
 * window manager, if any, to resize the window at runtime.  When this
 * occurs, SDL will send a SDL_VIDEORESIZE event to you application,
 * and you must respond to the event by re-calling SDL_SetVideoMode()
 * with the requested size (or another size that suits the application).
 *
 * If SDL_NOFRAME is set in 'flags', the SDL library will create a window
 * without any title bar or frame decoration.  Fullscreen video modes have
 * this flag set automatically.
 *
 * This function returns the video framebuffer surface, or NULL if it fails.
